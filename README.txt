Visual_Sorting

This project is for having visual aid when using sorting algorithms on Python.

Right now there is three files:
1 - 'randomizador.py': is used to generate a continuos shuffled list.
2 - 'lista.json': is used to store the list created above (must be set mannually).
3 - 'sorting_visual.py': is the program that displays the sorting steps as bars in a window.
